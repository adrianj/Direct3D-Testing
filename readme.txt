A Project for testing C# Direct3D Programming using SlimDX.

Includes a basic Direct3DEngine, where all shapes are defined as Vertices with Position, Normal and Colour.
This engine is used within a UserControl called Direct3DControl for integrating into simple windows apps, albeit with some special methods to run the for message pump.
A UserControl called Earth3DControl makes use of the Direct3DControl to provide a mapped terrain surface.
